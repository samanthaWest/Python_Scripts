Classification of sorting
- based on the number of swaps or inversion (number of times alg swaps elements) Selection Sort requires minimum number of swaps
-  Based on the number of comparisons
- Based on recursion or non recursive. Quick sort uses recursive technizes and others like selection sort or insert sort use non req technizes
- Merge sort use both recursive and non recursive to sort input
- Based on stability
- Insert Sort, merge sort, bubble sort are stable
- heap and quick sort are not stablespace requirements
-insertion sort and quick sort are in place sort as we move elements and dont actually use seperate array while merge sort does.
- merge sort is an example of out of place sort, as it requires extta memory and space
