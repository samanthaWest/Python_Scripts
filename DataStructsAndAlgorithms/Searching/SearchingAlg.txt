Array Vs Linked List
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnYpsTmfDc&ab_channel=Simplilearn 

There are 2 things to consider
- the bounds of linked list vs and array for a particular operation and the real word implementation and usage pattern including cache-locality and allocations
- accessing an indexed element in an array is very fast vs that operation on a linked list is long cause you need to know next and next. But if linked listis already
traversed then it is the same time to take. 
- Adding or removing eleemtns is a lot faster in an array
- iterating seq over a list is more or less the same speed as an array
- in some cases an array will take up more space as it extends
- many insertions, iterating sequiantly = linked list
- random access and ideally pre-defined size = array
